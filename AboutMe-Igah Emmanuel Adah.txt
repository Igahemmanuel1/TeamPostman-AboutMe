I am inquisitive in learning something new and always wanted to go into I.T though studied Food Science and Technology for my first major Bachelor degree and due to my quest for knowledge later went to study Mechanical Engineering in the same university.
I have worked in the Hospital which i did data entry in the Pharmacy, NHIS and the HIV Department.
I have some teaching skills and that led to also acquire a PGD in Education and currently running my Masters Program.
I hope to be among Tech giants soon
